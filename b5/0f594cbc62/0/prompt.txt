is there a way to pass geolite db file or disable download in management?

---

update ../docs/ page /selfhosted/geo-support and describe an issue and solution to this https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/5216 : So you can:
  1. Set --disable-geolite-update (to prevent overwriting)
  2. Download your own  geolite file https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data/
  3. Place your own file in the data directory named like GeoLite2-City_20240101.mmdb

also specify where users can find the volume data and that it looks something like that: root@selfhosted-1:/var/lib/docker/volumes/combined3_netbird_data/_data# ls -l
total 72452
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 63524357 Feb 13 23:00 GeoLite2-City_20260127.mmdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   425984 Feb 17 19:31 events.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  7307264 Feb 13 23:00 geonames_20260127.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    98304 Feb 18 14:07 idp.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  2826240 Feb 18 14:07 store.db
root@selfhosted-1:/var/lib/docker/volumes/combined3_netbird_data/_data#

also refer to this parameter: https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/blob/318cf59d660ef6195f86b8982d38acb891c0beb6/combined/config.yaml.example#L72
and describe why this may happen

my bad, this is proper prorpty: https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/blob/318cf59d660ef6195f86b8982d38acb891c0beb6/combined/config-simple.yaml.example#L81

---

I wnna double check that posthog metrics are being sent even if peole use combined/

---

is /Users/misha/Documents/GolandProjects/netbird/netbird/combined/config.yaml.example relevant?

---

but will it work actually

---

im not talking about c.Management.DisableGeoliteUpdate but in general about the config I refered to

---

lets rename simple to config-simple.yaml.example to config.yaml.example

lets rename simple to config-simple.yaml.example to config.yaml.example and remove the broken one

add this fork calderbit:feat/legacy-auth-migration

---

given that we have dsn and store config in the combined/ config, support a new section for activity events with engine type and dsn. Research code first for that

---

use these tips, these variables are present in the code: NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE, NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_POSTGRES_DSN

---

yes go ahead but config-simple.yaml.example doesnt exist, use config.yaml.example

continue but double check if activity store supports mysql besides postgres and sqlite

Do we need an encryption key ?
