is there a way to pass geolite db file or disable download in management?

---

update ../docs/ page /selfhosted/geo-support and describe an issue and solution to this https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/pull/5216 : So you can:
  1. Set --disable-geolite-update (to prevent overwriting)
  2. Download your own  geolite file https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data/
  3. Place your own file in the data directory named like GeoLite2-City_20240101.mmdb

also specify where users can find the volume data and that it looks something like that: root@selfhosted-1:/var/lib/docker/volumes/combined3_netbird_data/_data# ls -l
total 72452
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 63524357 Feb 13 23:00 GeoLite2-City_20260127.mmdb
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   425984 Feb 17 19:31 events.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  7307264 Feb 13 23:00 geonames_20260127.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    98304 Feb 18 14:07 idp.db
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  2826240 Feb 18 14:07 store.db
root@selfhosted-1:/var/lib/docker/volumes/combined3_netbird_data/_data#

also refer to this parameter: https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/blob/318cf59d660ef6195f86b8982d38acb891c0beb6/combined/config.yaml.example#L72
and describe why this may happen

my bad, this is proper prorpty: https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird/blob/318cf59d660ef6195f86b8982d38acb891c0beb6/combined/config-simple.yaml.example#L81

---

I wnna double check that posthog metrics are being sent even if peole use combined/

---

is /Users/misha/Documents/GolandProjects/netbird/netbird/combined/config.yaml.example relevant?

---

but will it work actually

---

im not talking about c.Management.DisableGeoliteUpdate but in general about the config I refered to

---

lets rename simple to config-simple.yaml.example to config.yaml.example

lets rename simple to config-simple.yaml.example to config.yaml.example and remove the broken one

add this fork calderbit:feat/legacy-auth-migration

---

given that we have dsn and store config in the combined/ config, support a new section for activity events with engine type and dsn. Research code first for that

---

---

use these tips, these variables are present in the code: NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE, NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_POSTGRES_DSN

---

yes go ahead but config-simple.yaml.example doesnt exist, use config.yaml.example

---

continue but double check if activity store supports mysql besides postgres and sqlite

---

Do we need an encryption key ?

---

do a check when setting envs, if engine is postgres and no dsn provided, we fail. It fails later when checking envs, but we should fail fast not to confuse a user

---

give me an example of dsn runnning locally on my machine port 5432 user password postgres

how to change postgres password

In `@combined/cmd/root.go` around lines 144 - 152, The engine value is normalized
for validation but the raw string is written to NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE
and may not match types.PostgresStoreEngine in initDatabase(); also
NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_POSTGRES_DSN can contain credentials and is logged unmasked.
Fix by lowercasing the engine before calling
os.Setenv("NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_STORE_ENGINE", ...) (use strings.ToLower(engine) or
a normalized variable) so comparisons in
initDatabase()/types.PostgresStoreEngine succeed, and update logEnvVars() to
treat NB_ACTIVITY_EVENT_POSTGRES_DSN (or any keys containing "dsn") as sensitive
by masking its value when logging to avoid exposing credentials.

I wanna add metrics to posthog, in addiiton to the ones that report IdP stats of teh selfhosted instances. The metric should indicate type of the IDP if embeddedIDP is enabled. We have a bunch of types, plz do this. Here is the list of idps: /Users/misha/Documents/GolandProjects/netbird/netbird/management/server/types/identity_provider.go

---

decode this dex id: "REDACTED"

---

add a test for newly added metrics: /Users/misha/Documents/GolandProjects/netbird/netbird/management/server/metrics/selfhosted_test.go

---

add new metric - number of idps configured when embedded idp is enabled

can't yo uresue embeddedIdpTypes?
