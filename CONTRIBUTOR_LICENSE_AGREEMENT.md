## 1 Preamble
In order to clarify the IP Rights situation with regard to Contributions from any person or entity, NetBird 
must have a contributor license agreement on file to be signed by each Contributor, containing the license 
terms below. This license serves as protection for both the Contributor as well as NetBird and its software users; 
it does not change Contributor’s rights to use his/her own Contributions for any other purpose.

## 2 Definitions

2.2 "Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is or previously has been intentionally Submitted by Contributor to NetBird for inclusion in, or documentation of any Work. 

2.3 "Contributor" shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is concluding this Agreement with NetBird. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

2.4 "Submitted" shall mean any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to NetBird or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, NetBird for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is marked or otherwise designated in writing by Contributor as "Not a Contribution".

2.5 "Work" means any of the products owned or managed by NetBird, in particular, but not exclusively, software.

## 3 Licenses 
3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement, Contributor hereby grants to NetBird and to recipients of software distributed by NetBird a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to reproduce by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, permanently or temporarily, the Contributions (including loading, displaying, executing, transmitting or storing works for the purpose of executing and processing data or transferring them to video, audio and other data carriers), including the right to distribute, display and present such Contributions and make them available to the public (e.g. via the internet) and to transmit and display such Contributions by any means.

3.3 NetBird hereby accepts such licenses. 

## 4 Contributor’s Representations
